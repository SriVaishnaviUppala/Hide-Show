	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Space exploration, investigation, by means of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft, of the reaches of <br>the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere and the use of the information so gained to increase knowl-<br>edge of the cosmos and benefit humanity.

With the development of rockets and the advances in electronics and other techno-<br>logies in the 20th century, it became possible to send machines and animals and then people above<br> Earth’s atmosphere into outer space. Well before technology made these achievements possible,<br>however, space exploration had already captured the minds of many people, not only aircraft pilots<br> and scientists but also writers and artists. </p>
